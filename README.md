Open access data for the publication ["Non-zero noise extrapolation: accurately simulating noisy quantum circuits with tensor networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13237) by Anthony P. Thompson, Arie Soeteman, Chris Cade, and Ido Niesen.

## Explanation
In the above mentioned work, a method for tensor network based emulation of noisy quantum circuits was introduced named ['Non-zero noise extrapolation'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13237). This repository includes supporting data for all figures presented in that publication (available in the directory `data`) as well as an example script written in python to reproduce the extrapolation method (available in the directory `src/nzne`).
